      <description>My name is Karim Lahrichi. I live in Laval, Canada with my wife and our two beautiful daughters (3 and 0.5 yeard old).
I started my professional career as an actuarial analyst at Intact Insurance, the biggest P&amp;amp;C insurer in Canada. After a few years, I made the switch to data science, which was a very natural transition thanks to my background in statistics. I then joined the newly formed Intact Datalab, where I was Senior Data Scientist.</description>

      <description>If you have written some piece of code that you find yourself using over and over again, why not turn it into a package and have it hosted on github ?
Here are some of the few benefits: - when your code is public, you will be shy about it and more likely to clean it up and comment it properly - other people might find your code useful - you can install your own package on your machine, and import it the same way you do any other standard package !</description>
