My name is Karim Lahrichi. I live in Laval, Canada with my wife and our two beautiful daughters (3 and 0.5 yeard old).

I started my professional career as an actuarial analyst at Intact Insurance, the biggest P&C insurer in Canada. After a few years, I made the switch to data science, which was a very natural transition thanks to my background in statistics. I then joined the newly formed Intact Datalab, where I was Senior Data Scientist. I really enjoyed my time there!

Today, I am Head of AI at [Flinks](https://flinks.io/), a financial aggregation startup based in Montreal. My main job consists of finding insights from large scale end-user financial transaction data (the type of transactions that you see when you log into your bank account). I work mainly on the [**Attributes**](https://flinks.io/attributes/) product.

In my spare time, I teach at Concordia university, in Montreal. I've taught the course [BIG DATA VISUALIZATION AND STORYTELLING](https://www.concordia.ca/cce/courses/details.html?subject=CEBD&catalog_number=1251) in the past, and I'm now teaching [BIG DATA ANALYTICS FOR BUSINESS](https://www.concordia.ca/cce/courses/details.html?subject=CEBD&catalog_number=1151).

I'm also a mentor on Springboard, in the [business analytics track](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/analytics/), where I help the students throughout their curriculum with technical tips as well as provide a broader business-oriented perspective.
