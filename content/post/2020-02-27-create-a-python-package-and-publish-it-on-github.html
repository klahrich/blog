<p>If you have written some piece of code that you find yourself using over and over again, why not turn it into a package and have it hosted on github ?</p>
<p>Here are some of the few benefits: - when your code is public, you will be shy about it and more likely to clean it up and comment it properly - other people might find your code useful - you can install your own package on your machine, and <code>import</code> it the same way you do any other standard package !</p>
<p>And really, packaging python code is actually SUPER easy – despite what the scattered online documentation would have you believe.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to do:</p>
<div id="folder-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>1. FOLDER STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>Your code should be structured as such:</p>
<pre><code>project_root_folder
|
|_setup.py
|
|_package_name
  |_ __init__.py
  |_python_module1.py
  |_python_module2.py</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>__init__.py</code> should be just an empty file. The purpose of it is to let the Python interpreter know that there are some modules that can be imported inside this directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="setup.py" class="section level2">
<h2>2. SETUP.PY</h2>
<p>The <code>setup.py</code> tells <code>pip</code> what to do when installing a package. A minimal <code>setup.py</code> file would look something like this:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name=&#39;{your_package_name}&#39;,
    url=&#39;https://github.com/{your_username}/{repo}&#39;,
    author=&#39;{Firstname} {Lastname}&#39;,
    author_email=&#39;{email}&#39;,
    
    packages=find_packages(),
    
    install_requires=[&#39;{required_module1}&#39;, &#39;{required_module2&#39;}],
    version=&#39;0.1&#39;,
    license=&#39;MIT&#39;,
    description=&#39;{short_description}&#39;,
)</code></pre>
<p>At this stage, you could already install your package locally by running <code>python setup.py install</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="publish-install-from-github" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Publish &amp; install from github</h2>
<p>Simply push your code (i.e. everything under your <code>package_root_folder</code>) to a new repo on github, and…that’s it. Your package is now installable by anyone, with the following command: <code>pip install git+https://github.com/{your_username}/{your_package_name}.git</code></p>
<p>Make sure to add a nice README.md explaining what the package does, and youre good to go!</p>
<p>If you want to see a concrete simple example, I published one recently for cloud functions I often use but can’t remember: <a href="https://github.com/klahrich/easycloud">easycloud</a>.</p>
